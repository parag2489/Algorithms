# Algorithms
My implementations of algorithms.

1. **k-th smallest element in an array**: Implemented in Python using a min-heap (O(n + k log(n))), a max-heap (O(k + (n-k) log(k))) and median of medians algorithm (O(n)). Test cases are written to verify the correctness.
2. **Bit manipulation operations**: Implemented in Python.
